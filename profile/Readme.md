# BioSimulations ðŸ§¬

More comprehensive and more predictive models have the potential to advance biology, bioengineering, and medicine. Building more predictive models will likely require the collaborative efforts of many investigators. This requires teams to be able to share and reuse model components and simulations. Despite extensive efforts to develop standards such as the [COMBINE/OMEX archive format](https://combinearchive.org/), the [Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO)](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/), the [Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)](http://sbml.org/), and the [Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)](https://www.sed-ml.org/) and repositories such as [BioModels](http://biomodels.net/) and the [Physiome Model Repository](https://models.physiomeproject.org/), it is still often difficult to share and reuse models and simulations. One challenge to sharing and reusing models is the disparate formats, model repositories, and simulation tools for different types of models. The proliferation of numerous similar formats, repositories, and tools makes it difficult, especially for non-experts, to find models and to find an appropriate simulation tool for each model. In addition, the existing model repositories have limited capabilities for sharing associated resources such as training data, simulation experiments, and visualizations.

The BioSimulations project seeks to adress these challenges by making it easier for researchers to share an reuse simulations. More information about the various components of the project can be found in their individual repositories, and on our [documentation page](https://docs.biosimulations.org).
